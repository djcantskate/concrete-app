# Concrete

A full stack skate session tracking app built with the MERN stack. Concrete lets skaters log sessions, track trick attempts with landed/total counts, and visualize their progress over time.

Live demo: coming soon

---

## Features

- **Session logging** - create sessions with a label, date, location, notes, and tricks
- **Trick tracking** - log landed and total attempts per trick with a real-time success rate badge and progress bar
- **Counter** - tally trick attempts live at the skatepark, then import them directly into a new or existing session
- **Location autocomplete** - powered by Google Places API with GPS current location support
- **JWT authentication** - secure register and login with bcrypt password hashing and token-scoped data access
- **Dark mode** - follows the user's system preference automatically

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend**
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- bcryptjs
- express-rate-limit

**APIs**
- Google Places API - location autocomplete
- Google Maps Static API - map pin previews on session cards
- Google Geocoding API - GPS coordinates to address

---

## Architecture

The backend is structured into separate models, middleware, and route files:

```
backend/
  models/
    User.js       - Mongoose schema for users
    Session.js    - Mongoose schema for sessions with embedded tricks
  middleware/
    auth.js       - JWT verification middleware
  routes/
    auth.js       - register, login, /me
    sessions.js   - session CRUD (all protected)
    places.js     - Google Places proxy (protects API key)
  server.js       - app setup, middleware, route mounting
```

All session routes are scoped by `userId` extracted from the JWT so users can only read and modify their own data. Google API calls are proxied through the backend so the API key is never exposed to the client.

---

## Security

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt before storage
- JWTs expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting on auth routes (10 requests per 15 minutes per IP) to prevent brute force attacks
- CORS restricted to the frontend origin
- API keys stored in environment variables, never committed to version control
- Third-party API calls proxied through the backend

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, MongoDB (local or Atlas)

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djcantskate/concrete.git
cd concrete
```

**2. Set up the backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_key
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**3. Set up the frontend**
```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
